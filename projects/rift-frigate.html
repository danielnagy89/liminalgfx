			<h1 style="font-size:2.6rem;">Accuracy Process</h1>
			<p>For this project I've tried to use an obscure method to replicating a 3D model accurately from a set of images. I've used the discontinued Autodesk Image Modeler (no longer on the market) to place a cluster of Locators (points with same location). How it works is, AIM loads the images and assigns a camera with specific settings to each image. The locators are shared between the cameras/ images, so adjusting them by what you see in each image will give it the spatial location relative to the cameras.</p>

		<li>✔️ Remember AAA asset pipeline top-to-bottom</li>
		<li>✔️ Deepened experience with Substance Painter, came up with some generator tricks, Passthrough layers and Anchor Points.</li>
		<li>✔️ Tried Camera Matching → Control Points → Curves → Curves to Mesh workflow. Good option, but cumbersome at the moment. Suggested to Mike Kingsnorth to create a replacement for Autodesk Image Modeller, went nowhere.</li>
		<li>✔️ Scouting-ahead workflow, putting the asset in the next step to see what problems turn up.</li>
		<li>✔️ Tried RizomUV and determined it's superfluous for this use. The roundtripping isn't worth it when you have Blender/ ZenUV/ UVPackmaster stack. Being able to edit the geometry while unwrapping is essential.</li>
		<li>✔️ Learned Marmoset Toolbag bake and presentation workflow.</li>
		<li>🟡 Stubbornly packed everything on one texture (indie atlasing inertia). I could have benefited from a couple of UDIMs.</li>
